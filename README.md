## Description

The `Public_repo_README_file_generator` is an automated tool designed to generate comprehensive and professional `README.md` files for public GitHub repositories. It achieves this by fetching repository metadata and leveraging a structured prompt (likely for an AI model) to craft well-organized and informative documentation, saving developers time and ensuring consistency across projects.

## Features

*   **Automated README Generation**: Quickly generate a `README.md` file based on a repository's public information.
*   **Repository Data Fetching**: Automatically retrieves key details such as project name, description (if available), language, and file structure from the target GitHub repository.
*   **Markdown Output**: Generates the README in standard Markdown format, ready for immediate use on GitHub.
*   **Customizable Prompt**: Utilizes a `prompt.txt` file to guide the content generation, allowing for specific instructions or desired sections in the README.
*   **Environment Variable Configuration**: Securely manages API keys and other sensitive information using `.env` files.

## Installation Guide

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (Node Package Manager)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karanbansal2506/Public_repo_README_file_generator.git
    cd Public_repo_README_file_generator
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store your API keys.      
    ```env
    # Example .env content - adjust according to actual API requirements
    GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token # Required for higher rate limits or private repo access (if extended)
    AI_API_KEY=your_generative_ai_api_key         # e.g., for Google Generative AI, OpenAI, etc.        
    ```
    *   **GitHub Token**: You might need a GitHub Personal Access Token if you hit API rate limits or if the generator eventually supports private repos. For public repos, it might not be strictly necessary for basic info but is good practice. Generate one from [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
    *   **AI API Key**: This project likely uses a Generative AI model. Obtain an API key from your chosen provider (e.g., Google Cloud for Gemini API, OpenAI for ChatGPT, etc.).

## Usage

To generate a README for a public GitHub repository, run the `main.js` script, passing the target repository's full name (owner/repo) or URL as an argument.

```bash
node main.js <repository_owner>/<repository_name>
```
or
```bash
node main.js https://github.com/<repository_owner>/<repository_name>
```

**Example:**

To generate a README for the `Public_repo_README_file_generator` itself:

```bash
node main.js karanbansal2506/Public_repo_README_file_generator
```

The generated README content will be printed to the console or saved to a file, depending on the implementation in `main.js`.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

*   **JavaScript**: The core programming language.
*   **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript server-side.
*   **npm**: Package manager for Node.js.
*   **`dotenv`**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
*   **GitHub API (via Octokit/Axios)**: Likely used to fetch repository metadata.
*   **Generative AI API (e.g., Google Generative AI, OpenAI)**: The backbone for generating human-like text content for the README.
